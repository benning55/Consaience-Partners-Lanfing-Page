## **Industrial Use Case: AI-Powered Contact Center Automation**

### **Challenge**

Whether you’re an **SME** scaling your first customer support team or a **global enterprise** managing thousands of daily inquiries, manual case handling slows down operations and increases costs. Agents spend valuable time answering repetitive questions instead of solving complex issues.

### **Solution**

We implemented **Salesforce Agentforce** to create an **AI-powered contact center** that integrates directly with your **CRM data** and **Knowledge Articles**.

The system:

- Understands and responds to customer inquiries automatically
- Retrieves accurate, context-aware answers from internal data
- Routes complex cases to human agents with full case history

## 🛒 **Use Case: Retail & eCommerce — Automated Customer Enquiry Resolution**

### **Challenge**

Retailers and online sellers, from growing D2C brands to global chains, manage thousands of daily inquiries on order tracking, returns, and promotions. Traditional customer service models can’t scale without adding headcount.

---

### **Solution**

The system:

- Instantly answers “Where is my order?” or “How do I return this item?” questions

- Continuously learns from resolved cases to improve accuracy
