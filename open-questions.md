## Open Questions & Recommendations (Post Pitch-Deck Refresh)

### Content & Proof Points
- **Hero CTAs**: Confirm final CTA labels. Current copy uses "Book a strategy call" (primary) and "See the full solution" (secondary).
- **Verified Outcomes**: Metrics still cite "30-50% manual workload reduction" and "Up to 50% enquiries auto-resolved". Provide confirmed benchmarks or swap in anonymised customer stats for investor diligence.
- **Additional Verticals**: Only Contact Centre and Retail scenarios are showcased. Supply additional use cases (e.g., Financial Services, SaaS, Healthcare) if they exist.
- **Logos / Case Studies**: Provide partner or client badges to reinforce credibility on Slides 2–5.

### Visual & Narrative Enhancements
- Decide whether slide numbering should remain visible on mobile or become desktop-only.
- Consider supplying diagrams or screen captures for the "Implementation Blueprint" slide to visualise the three-step flow.
- A short product demo video or animated walkthrough would strengthen the pitch narrative.

### Team & Trust Signals
- `/bio` now outlines leadership pods. Share named bios, headshots, credentials, and LinkedIn links to replace the generic pods once available.
- Confirm preferred public-facing contact methods (email, phone, LinkedIn) for the footer and contact page.

### Measurement & Follow-up
- Enable analytics events for slide engagement (scroll depth) to see where investors spend time.
- If we want to experiment with alternative hero problem statements, consider adding an A/B testing framework.
